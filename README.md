About the system
------
The CES system consists of two parts. The the Android application and Web application.

CES Android is a software application for your Android device. It will read out several data and sensors via OBD2 interface. 
This is done by using the [OBD2 ELM327 hardware dongle](http://elm327.nl/index.php?id_product=1&controller=product). The Android application will sent the data to the webserver and store the data as well.

On a webpage it is possible to view the data over time as well as watching the real-time data.


Please take a look at the [CES - Web app](https://github.com/danger89/CES_Web)
